INSTRUCTIONS

There is only one solution file inside the project (and one level for the game), start it up and press space to start playing and use arrow keys to move the paddle. 

Added sounds as bonus for the exam 

Sometimes the brick explosion sound may not start because the sound file is set to "Repeat only once"
